## Session: 2026-01-07 (Night)

### Summary
Set up BOSS pedal scraper and imported 41 pedals to Supabase database.

### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Reviewed scraper folder contents (boss_scraper.py, pedal.schema.json, import-pedals.js)
- [x] Added scraper/ to .gitignore (contains local JSON data files)
- [x] Fixed Python 3.9 compatibility in boss_scraper.py (Optional[] type hints)
- [x] Ran BOSS scraper - collected 41 pedals with dimensions, power specs, and I/O info
- [x] Created import-pedals.js to transform scraped data to database schema
- [x] Fixed column name mismatch (supports_4_cable vs supports_4cable)
- [x] Added SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to bypass RLS for system pedal inserts
- [x] Successfully imported 41 BOSS pedals to database

### Key Changes
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.gitignore` | Added scraper/ to ignore local JSON data files |
| `package.json` | Added dotenv dependency for import script |
| `scraper/boss_scraper.py` | Fixed Python 3.9 compatibility (typing imports) |
| `scraper/import-pedals.js` | Created import script with category mapping |
| `scraper/boss_pedals.json` | Generated 41 BOSS pedals (not committed) |
| `.env.local` | Added SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY |

### Technical Decisions
1. **Service role key for system pedals**: RLS policy prevents regular users from inserting `is_system=true` pedals. Service role bypasses RLS.
2. **Category mapping**: Scraper types (chorus, flanger, phaser, vibrato, rotary) map to database `modulation` category
3. **Scraper folder in gitignore**: JSON output files contain scraped data that shouldn't be in version control

### Architecture Notes
**RLS Policies for pedals table:**
- SELECT: System pedals viewable by everyone (`is_system = true`)
- SELECT: Users can view their own pedals (`auth.uid() = created_by`)
- INSERT: Users can only create non-system pedals (`is_system = false`)
- UPDATE/DELETE: Users can only modify their own non-system pedals

**Import script flow:**
1. Read scraped JSON
2. Transform to database schema (dimensions, power, category mapping)
3. Check for existing pedals by manufacturer + name
4. Insert new / update existing

### Next Tasks
- [ ] Add more manufacturer scrapers (Strymon, EHX, MXR)
- [ ] Add pedal jack positions (top-mounted vs side-mounted)
- [ ] Consider adding pedal images to the UI

## Session: 2026-01-07 (Evening)

### Summary
UI audit and fixes for layout bugs, plus cable routing improvements for effects loop support.

### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Fixed responsive layout with collapsible panels for mobile
- [x] Added mobile hamburger menu to header
- [x] Made toolbar responsive with overflow menu
- [x] Fixed pedal library panel overflow (color dots and "Added" badge)
- [x] Added proper container padding for dashboard
- [x] Fixed right panel sheet only opening on mobile
- [x] Added amp panel visualization with RTN/SND/IN jacks for effects loop
- [x] Fixed cable routing for effects loop connections
- [x] Fixed amp_send → pedal routing to go through open channel (not through pedal body)
- [x] Standardized spacing values across panels

### Key Changes
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/app/(dashboard)/editor/[id]/editor-client.tsx` | Added Sheet components for mobile panels, responsive layout |
| `src/app/globals.css` | Added container class with responsive padding |
| `src/components/editor/canvas/cable-renderer.tsx` | Added useEffectsLoop prop, improved external→pedal routing to approach from below |
| `src/components/editor/canvas/editor-canvas.tsx` | Added amp panel with RTN/SND/IN jacks visualization |
| `src/components/editor/panels/pedal-library-panel.tsx` | Fixed overflow - moved color dot left, replaced "Added" with checkmark |
| `src/components/editor/toolbar/editor-toolbar.tsx` | Made responsive with overflow dropdown menu |
| `src/components/layout/header.tsx` | Added mobile hamburger menu |
| `src/components/editor/panels/*.tsx` | Standardized spacing (gap-2, p-2/p-3, space-y-1/2/3) |

### Technical Decisions
1. **Mobile breakpoint at lg (1024px)**: Panels collapse into Sheet components on mobile
2. **Effects loop amp visualization**: Shows three jacks (RTN top, SND middle, IN bottom) when FX loop enabled
3. **External→pedal routing**: Now approaches pedals from below through the open channel between rows, avoiding routing through pedal bodies
4. **Pedal→external routing**: Uses L-shaped paths with standoff points, validated before use

### Architecture Notes
Cable routing for effects loop now properly splits signal:
- Front chain: Guitar → pedals → amp_input (bottom jack)
- Loop chain: amp_send (middle jack) → pedals → amp_return (top jack)

The `useEffectsLoop` prop is passed to CableRenderer to position amp_input jack correctly.

External→pedal routing calculates approach point below the destination pedal and routes through the channel.

### Next Tasks
- [ ] Test with different board layouts and pedal arrangements
- [ ] Consider optimizing cable paths for visual cleanliness
- [ ] Mobile touch interactions for drag-and-drop

## Session: 2026-01-07

### Summary
Major refactor of cable routing algorithm to fix cables passing through pedals.

### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Fixed cable routing - cables no longer pass through pedals
- [x] Fixed Z-shaped routing between adjacent pedals
- [x] Fixed amp/guitar cable bump issue (up-then-down zigzag)
- [x] Disabled debug logging for production
- [x] Build verified passing

### Key Changes
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/editor/canvas/cable-renderer.tsx` | Major refactor (714 insertions, 954 deletions) |
| `.claude/scripts/debug-cables.js` | New debug script |
| `.claude/scripts/screenshot-optimized.js` | New screenshot script for post-optimize testing |

### Technical Decisions
1. **Standoff points (35px)**: Added standoff points outside pedal boxes to ensure cables route around pedals, not through them
2. **Three routing strategies**:
   - Short distance (<120px): Direct routing for adjacent pedals
   - External connections (guitar/amp): L-shaped routing with standoff only on pedal side
   - Long pedal-to-pedal: Full standoffs on both sides with A* routing
3. **L-shaped routing for external connections**: Simpler than A* and avoids zigzag artifacts

### Architecture Notes
The cable routing in `cable-renderer.tsx` now uses:
- `getStandoffPoint()` - Calculates points outside pedal boxes based on jack edge position
- `findPathAStar()` - Grid-based A* pathfinding with Manhattan distance heuristic
- `smoothPath()` - Removes small zigzag deviations from paths

### Next Tasks
- [ ] Consider cable color differentiation for different signal types
- [ ] Look into cable bundling when multiple cables share similar paths
- [ ] Test with more complex pedalboard layouts
