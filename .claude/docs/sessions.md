## Session: 2026-01-07

### Summary
Major refactor of cable routing algorithm to fix cables passing through pedals.

### What Was Accomplished
- [x] Fixed cable routing - cables no longer pass through pedals
- [x] Fixed Z-shaped routing between adjacent pedals
- [x] Fixed amp/guitar cable bump issue (up-then-down zigzag)
- [x] Disabled debug logging for production
- [x] Build verified passing

### Key Changes
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/editor/canvas/cable-renderer.tsx` | Major refactor (714 insertions, 954 deletions) |
| `.claude/scripts/debug-cables.js` | New debug script |
| `.claude/scripts/screenshot-optimized.js` | New screenshot script for post-optimize testing |

### Technical Decisions
1. **Standoff points (35px)**: Added standoff points outside pedal boxes to ensure cables route around pedals, not through them
2. **Three routing strategies**:
   - Short distance (<120px): Direct routing for adjacent pedals
   - External connections (guitar/amp): L-shaped routing with standoff only on pedal side
   - Long pedal-to-pedal: Full standoffs on both sides with A* routing
3. **L-shaped routing for external connections**: Simpler than A* and avoids zigzag artifacts

### Architecture Notes
The cable routing in `cable-renderer.tsx` now uses:
- `getStandoffPoint()` - Calculates points outside pedal boxes based on jack edge position
- `findPathAStar()` - Grid-based A* pathfinding with Manhattan distance heuristic
- `smoothPath()` - Removes small zigzag deviations from paths

### Next Tasks
- [ ] Consider cable color differentiation for different signal types
- [ ] Look into cable bundling when multiple cables share similar paths
- [ ] Test with more complex pedalboard layouts
